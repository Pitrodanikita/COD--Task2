# COD--Task2

explaination of code : 
This Java code creates a simple chatbot program that engages in conversation with the user. Let's break it down step by step:

1.Package and Imports:
The code is in the package chat.
It imports java.util.*, which includes utilities such as Scanner for input.

2.Class Declaration:
The class MyChatbot is declared, containing the main method and other methods for chat functionalities.

3.Main Method:
Inside the main method, an instance of MyChatbot is created.
The beginChat method is called on this instance to start the conversation.

4.beginChat Method:
This method handles the conversation with the user.
It starts by greeting the user and asking for their name.
Then, it enters a loop where it continuously reads user input, sends a response, and checks if the user wants to end the conversation (by typing "bye").
When the user types "bye", the loop breaks, and the program bids farewell to the user.

5.SendResponse Method:
This method takes user input as a parameter and returns a response based on the input.
It converts the input to lowercase for easier comparison.
It uses a switch-case statement to determine the appropriate response based on the input.
If the input matches one of the predefined cases (e.g., "hello", "how are you"), it returns the corresponding response.
If the input doesn't match any predefined case, it calls the provideRandomResponse method to generate a random response.

6.provideRandomResponse Method:
This method provides a random response when the user input doesn't match any predefined cases.
It contains an array of possible responses.
It generates a random index within the range of the response array and returns the response at that index.

Overall, this code creates a basic chatbot that responds to specific user inputs with predefined responses and generates random responses for other inputs.
